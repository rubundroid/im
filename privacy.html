    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Indent Maker</strong> app and website. By using this service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any sensitive personal data. However, to improve our app and understand user demographics, we use basic analytics tools (such as Google Analytics and custom tracking via Google Forms). This process may collect your IP address to determine your general location (City/State) and the institution name you voluntarily provide.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
    <p>The collected information is strictly used for internal analytical purposes to improve user experience. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third-party marketing agencies.</p>

    <h2>3. Offline Functionality & Storage</h2>
    <p>This app uses your device's local storage (Cache and LocalStorage) to enable offline functionality and save your draft indents. This data remains on your device and is not uploaded to our servers.</p>

    <h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires internet access to fetch updates and analytics. It does not access your camera, contacts, or internal files without your explicit action (e.g., saving a PDF document).</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact the developer.</p>
